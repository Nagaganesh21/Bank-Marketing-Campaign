# Term Deposit Prediction Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Term Deposit Prediction Project! In this project, I'll be working on a computer vision task and utilizing artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various attributes.

## Dataset

The project dataset contains information related to direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. Your task is to explore this dataset, preprocess the data, and build an ANN model that can effectively analyze and classify the given features.

## Project Tasks

1. **Data Exploration**: Dive into the dataset to gain insights into its structure and characteristics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for training the ANN by handling missing values, scaling features, and any necessary transformations.

3. **Model Development**: Create an artificial neural network (ANN) model suitable for binary classification.

4. **Model Training**: Train the ANN model using the preprocessed data to accurately predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to develop an effective model that contributes to the bank's marketing campaign strategies. Your efforts and skills can lead to innovative solutions and remarkable achievements in the field of predictive analytics.
